Mapping when/where food pickups are available during covid-19 crisis

Please join our Slack channel, #p-covid19. (Please go to openmaine.org to find a link
to join our Slack, plus more information about OpenMaine.)

(README started with the initial project idea, and will need to be edited as we go along...)

Initial map is Portland Schools, and online here: http://openmaine.org/covid19/food.html

# Community Partners

We've been asked by the Mutual Aid group Mainers Together (mainerstogether.com) to put together a map for their organizers to use when assisting need requests. This map would have updated hours and pick up/drop off locations. We will coordinate with Mainers Together to conduct outreach and data validation.
