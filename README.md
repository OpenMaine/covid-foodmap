Initial map is Portland Schools, and online here: http://openmaine.org/covid19/food.html

# What problem are you trying to solve?
[A lot of pantries and food distribution centers are changing their hours and practices rapidly. It's hard to keep up, and info is siloed by county or town]

# In less than 140 characters explain your idea?
[Create a map with crowdsourced data to collect info statewide for people needing food.]

# Who will benefit from your project? Can you tell their story?
[Anyone who is looking for food and can't get it either because they can't afford it or because it has run out]

# What area of Civic Engagement would you put this under? [1 or more]
Disaster and Humanitiarian Relief
What other resources/tools are currently serving the same need?
[https://www.gsfb.org/get-help/food-map/]

# Is there any data, research or code available for your current idea?
# Are there any Drawbacks to choosing this path?
[It would be better if we could help good shephard update theirs]

# What would success look like?
[Getting it shared and used by many people. Getting buy-in and support from agencies who need help getting food to people.]

# What help do you need now?
[Mapping, data aggregation]

# What are the next steps (validation, research, coding, design)?
[Getting answers from cumberland county food security council on statewide coordination efforts. Then research + data]
