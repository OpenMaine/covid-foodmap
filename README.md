# Community Partners

We've been asked by the Mutual Aid group Mainers Together (mainerstogether.com) to put together a map for their organizers to use when assisting need requests. This map would have updated hours and pick up/drop off locations. We will coordinate with Mainers Together to conduct outreach and data validation.
